# Hello! If you're here, you're probably an animint2 contributor who
# wants to make adjustments to this file. Part of this file was generated
# automatically. But most of this file was modified by hand. If
# usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() offers to modify this file, you
# should probably say no unless you know what you're doing. For more
# details, look at the website_setup.Rmd file. Thanks. :>
