/* EXPLANATION FOR THIS MESS
   
   You might be thinking: What is up with this garbage code? 
   What does it do, and how does it work? I can explain.
   
   
   1. What Does it Do?
   
   This code emulates Quarto's code annotation feature:
   https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.
   It manipulates comments in a specific codeblock in
   the quick start guide and transforms them into
   annotations.
   
   
   2. What is Up with this Garbage Code?
   
   R Markdown doesn't have the same feature, and I can't
   just write the HTML for it cuz I don't have direct
   access to it -- pkgdown generates it from codeblock I
   provide it. So I've had to hack it together.
   
   
   3. How Does it Work?
   
   I'm gonna assume you know CSS already. 
   
   #cb3 targets a specific codeblock, and span.co
   targets the comments in that codeblock.
   
   Most of the CSS is sensible. The two parts that may 
   not make a lot of sense are the border-radius 
   and color.
   
   The border-radius is like that because it lets the
   border take the shape of a capsule (or stadium):
   https://stackoverflow.com/a/18795153.
   
   color has !important cuz otherwise the default grey
   comment color will take over. I want the text in
   the annotation to be the same color as the text
   in the paragraphs.
   
   
   4. The End
   
   Hope this helps! If it doesn't, it shouldn't be
   too much work to reverse-engineer the few lines
   of CSS I've written here. Good luck!
