TODO

support variable mapping and scales that can the user can
interactively update.

OPTIMIZATION: for the prostateLasso test, it would be great to be able
to specify clickSelects=c(arclength="arclength.click") even if there
is no column named arclength in the data -- this would mean to update
the selector called "arclength" with the value in column
"arclength.click" -- less disk space, and faster compiling.

DEP: no longer depend on any branch of ggplot2.

train_layout from ggplot2 - R/panel.r function is now
g_train_layout. train_layout from animint2 - R/z_facet.R function is
the same. Both are internal functions.

DSL: clickSelects/showSelected are now specified as parameters rather
than aesthetics.
